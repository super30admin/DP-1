S30 FAANMG Problem #21 {Easy}

198. House Robber

Time Complexity : O(N)
 

Space Complexity : O(1)


Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes


We are using two pointers curr and prev

As the condition states:
     return the maximum amount of money you can rob  by choosing the alterantive houses to avoid alarns
    
So the max of max( curr , prev + nums[i]) is calculated

where for I
 curr is i-1
 prev = i-2
