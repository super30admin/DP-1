Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes


2D matrix is used to store the number of coins based on the amount chnages
the column represent the amount from 0
and the row consist of the didderent coins

The value of a particular cell is calculatesed as follows:
    
For the value of Jth column and ith row 
  untill j < coins[i-1]): dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] the value from above row
    else:
       the minimum of above value and the value 1 + dp[i][j- coins[i-1]]
       
             dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], 1 + dp[i][j- coins[i-1]])
